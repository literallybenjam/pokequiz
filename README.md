# POKÉQUIZ

A quiz for determining your inner Pokémon! Programmed for the web in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## method

The POKÉQUIZ uses three main pieces of information to determine which Pokémon best suits you. They are:

- Egg Group
- Type
- Habitat

Of these, the egg group is the most essential. There are lots of different Pokémon species, so chances are that you will get a different result from everyone you know. However, you can use egg group as a sort of barometer for Pokémon compatibility—for those of you who are into that sort of thing.

## endmatter

This quiz is unofficial and just for fun. Don't take it too seriously.
